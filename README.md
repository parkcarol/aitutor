## Meet AITutor

1. Never gives you the answer directly - but adapts to your level and gives you hints
2. Summarizes your chats into   notes for long term retention
3. Keeps creating quizzes to test you as you learn!
4. When you come back to review  your notes, it reminds you of the chat you had when you learnt this

### Key Design Principles

Socratic and adaptative:
- AI Tutor gives hints to help along the ‘confusion’ journey and prevent frustration from developing
- It is socratic when the user has knowledge and just needs a push to to apply it
- But... gives direct information when the user is missing key facts

Shared memory in chat and notes:
- The two panels have a shared ‘memory’ of the chat context and the notes - this allows the user to seamlessly connect between the two and jump back and forth 

Tutor nudges, student controls:
- Tutor will nudge -  say ‘take a quiz’ and ‘create a note’ when it feels the user has completed a learning goal 
- The user controls those actions and can independently trigger them
